# tplink-cloud-api
A Python library for to remotely control TP-Link smart home devices using their cloud service - no need to be on the same network as your devices

This is a Python port of Adumont's Node.js module:
https://github.com/adumont/tplink-cloud-api

# Introduction

The `tplinkcloud` Python module allows you to remotely control your TP-Link smartplugs (HS100, HS103, HS105, HS110, HS300), smart switches (HS200), and smartbulbs (LB100, LB110, LB120, LB130, KL60, KL110, KL120, KL130, and more) using the TP-Link cloud web service, from anywhere, without the need to be on the same wifi/lan.

It's especially useful in scenarios where you want to control your devices from public web services, like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), [Thinger.io](https://thinger.io/), [Webtask.io](https://webtask.io/), [Glitch.com](http://glitch.com/), Tasker (Android)...

# Device Compatibility

The following devices are _officially_ supported by the library at this time:
* HS300 (Smart Plug Power Strip with 6 Smart Outlets)

# Installation

The package is availble via PyPi and can be installed with the following command:
```
pip3 install tplink-cloud-api
```

To install it from the repo, clone the repo and cd into the directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/piekstra/tplink-cloud-api.git
cd tplink-cloud-api
```

You can install this library with `pip`:

```
pip3 install .
```

# Usage

## Authenticate

Instantiating a TP Link Device Manager automatically logs in with your TP-Link credentials, caches the login token, and fetches your devices. The current TP-Link Cloud API Url (https://wap.tplinkcloud.com) is assumed if not provided explicitly.

```python
from tplink_cloud_api import TPLinkDeviceManager

username='kasa@email.com'
password='secure'

device_manager = TPLinkDeviceManager(username, password)
```

## Retrieve devices

To view your devices, you can run the following:

```python
devices = device_manager.get_devices()
if devices:
  print(f'Found {len(devices)} devices')
  for device in devices:
    print(f'{device.model_type.name} device called {device.get_alias()}')
```

## Control your devices

### Smart Power Strips (HS300)

Toggle a plug:

```python
device_name = "My Smart Plug"
device = device_manager.find_device(device_name)
if device:
  print(f'Found {device.model_type.name} device: {device.get_alias()}')
  device.toggle()
else:  
  print(f'Could not find {device_name}')
```

Replace `My Smart Plug` with the alias you gave to your plug in the Kasa app (be sure to give a different alias to each device). Instead of `toggle()`, you can also use `power_on()` or `power_off()`.

To retrieve power consumption data for one of the individual plugs on the power strip:

```python
import json
power_usage = device_manager.find_device("My Smart Plug").get_power_usage()
print(json.dumps(power_usage, indent=2))
```

If you want to get multiple devices with a name including a certain substring, you can use the following:

```python
device_names_like = "plug"
devices = device_manager.find_devices(device_names_like)
if devices:
  print(f'Found {len(devices)} matching devices')
  for device in devices:
    print(f'{device.model_type.name} device called {device.get_alias()}')
```
